        <li>Marinate the chicken with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, biryani masala, red chili powder, turmeric, salt,
            lemon juice, and a little oil for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Rinse and soak basmati rice, then boil it with whole spices until about 70% cooked and drain it.</li>
        <li>Fry sliced onions in oil or ghee until golden, then add tomatoes (optional), green chilies, and the
            marinated chicken. Cook until the chicken is almost done and the gravy thickens.</li>
        <li>Layer half the rice in a heavy pot, add the cooked chicken over it, then cover with the remaining rice and
            sprinkle fried onions, mint, coriander, ghee, and saffron milk or food color.</li>
        <li>Cover tightly and cook on low heat for 20–25 minutes, then let it rest a few minutes before serving.</li>
