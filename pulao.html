    <ol>
        <li>Rinse and soak basmati rice for 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a pot, heat oil or ghee and fry sliced onions until golden, then add ginger-garlic paste, whole spices
            (bay leaf, cloves, cardamom, black pepper, cinnamon), and fry for a minute.</li>
        <li>Add beef, salt, and green chilies, then cook until the beef changes color. Add water and cook until the beef
            becomes tender (or pressure-cook it).</li>
        <li>Once the beef is soft, adjust the yakhni (broth) so the water level is right for the rice, then add the
            soaked rice and let it cook on medium heat until the water dries.</li>
        <li>Cover tightly and steam on low heat for 10 to 15 minutes, then fluff gently and serve.</li>
