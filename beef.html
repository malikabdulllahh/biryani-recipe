    <h1>Beef Biryani Recipe</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Marinate beef with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, biryani masala, red chili powder, turmeric, salt, lemon
            juice, and a little oil. Let it rest for at least 1 hour for better tenderness.</li>
        <li>Rinse and soak basmati rice, then boil it with whole spices until about 70% cooked and drain it.</li>
        <li>In a pot, fry sliced onions in oil or ghee until golden, then add tomatoes (optional), green chilies, and
            the marinated beef. Cook until the beef is tender—this may take longer, or you can pressure-cook it until
            soft.</li>
        <li>Spread half the rice in a heavy pot, add the cooked beef masala over it, then cover with the remaining rice
            and sprinkle fried onions, mint, coriander, ghee, and saffron milk or food color.</li>
        <li>Cover tightly and cook on low heat for 20 to 25 minutes so the flavors blend, then let it rest a few minutes
            before serving.</li>
